== Test Framework "Picard"

Picard is a test framework heavily inspired by "Spock" (an excellent test framework for the Groovy programming language). It does some AST manipulation to make the structure of your test explicit:

``
    def test_method
      given
        x = 1

      expect
        x == 1
    end
``

The "given" block is a setup you do for your test. Every line in the "expect" block is an assertion.
